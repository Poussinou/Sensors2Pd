Sensors2Pd
----------

Android app, that loads Pd patches and sends data from sensors to 
receivers in these patches.


Development and Building
------------------------

After cloning the source, you need to download the submodules:
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

After that, pd-for-android needs its submodules downloaded as well:
    cd pd-for-android
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

As a last step, you have to apply patches to pd-for-android and
MIDI for Android:
    sh apply-patches.sh
